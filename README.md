# distributions

Creation of two classes, Distributions and NumpyDistribution. Each class takes 4 inputs: distribution, mean, standard deviation, and size. Both classes randomly generate a number of samples (size) from a lognormal, normal, or laplace distribution (distribution) with specified mean and standard deviation. The class "Distributions" does this specifically without implementing NumPy methods whereas NumpyDistribution does this specifically with implementing NumPy methods. For example if you create the class instance my_distribution = Distributions(dist="lognormal", mean=1, std=5, samples=100) you can access the list of randomly generated distribution values or you can print my_distribution and see the distribution, size, and newly calculated mean and standard deviation of the object. Note that the larger the sample size is, the closer you get to the mean and standard deviation of the distribution sampled from. More information about the classes can be read in the docstring documentation.
